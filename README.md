ABOUT RENDEVOUS:

Rendevous is an event app where anyone can create an event that they want to share with others. This can be a party, conference, competition,etc. The following describes the main use case for the app we currently have. A user registers for the app and verifies their email from their email account and then comes back and sign in with those credentials. After signing up/in, you are prompted with additional signup information such as username, phone number and also a profile picture. Don't worry, first time users have an easy get around the app! An introduction screen is placed there for any new users to get a rundown of how Rendevous works.

On the home page they can either browse events on the map, or the list at the bottom of the screen. The list of events at the bottom have many features, tapping on it would center the camera to the event location, or holding the event would open more information about it(Date, time, host name, etc) where you can choose to attend or cancel. If you ever get lost on the map, there is a GPS button that centers the camera back to your current location, so be sure to check out anything as far away as you want! You can also see the events that you are hosting and which you are currently signed up for through the My Events page! Simply tapping on an Event on this page would open more information you may want to see, here you may choose to attend or even cancel, and also see any others attending that event. Wow, now you're attending events, hosting events, and even making connections with others on Rendezvous, you're a pro! You can always just go to the profile page to view your personal information and also edit anything you'd like with a tap of a button!

And if you ever get lost, there is always a side bar menu that you can simply tap and navigate to any other page you want just by tapping on that section! Be sure to have fun, stay safe and don't be afraid to go to some Rendezvous points!

DUE TO A FLUTTER DEV ISSUE (REOCCURRING ISSUE FROM 2019) IMAGE PICKERS FULLY WORK ON ACTUAL DEVICES RATHER THAN EMULATORS! PLEASE USE AN ACTUAL ANDROID DEVICE FOR THE FULL EXPERIENCE OF THE APP
